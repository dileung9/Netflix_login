# Netflix_login
This is my first project programming using HTML and CSS, using operations to recreate the Netflix login page. 
I decided to call this project just "Netflix login page". The main objective is to recreate the login page of the netflix website in the Brazilian Portuguese language. The choice to use HTML and CSS was simply because I'm still developing my first projects, so choosing something that was simpler and within my reach was a priority. The The main challenge I found was how to make the code more organized and functional at the same time.

# Methodology

I precisely demarcated each feature in divisions in the HTML code so that when making the changes in the CSS it was simpler and more organized. I developed this based on a class I saw on a YouTube channel. My main motivation was to practice, learn and memorize certain features that I use to code. During the execution I learned new things that I could add to my project to make it more enjoyable, in addition to learning things that could make my work simpler, but still more efficient.
I used the Visual Studio Code application to make the code. 

# How to use
To view the finished project, the user just has to run the "index.html" file found in this repository. In the "assets" folder you can find the images used and the design settings by CSS.
